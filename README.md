# Spotify Playlist Personal Recommender

## Description
In this project, I will be attempting to build a songs recommendation list based on my personal playlist. There is a current recommendation system made by Spotify however I do not find the majority songs recommended to me to my liking. I will see if I can build a more personalised system that suits my tastes more. Additionally, I will also explore to see what aspects of a song makes me tick and in turn make me like it.   

## Credits
I followed a tutorial for the most part of this project from https://github.com/madhavthaker/spotify-recommendation-system and credit must be given to Madhav Thaker for the excellent tutorial and code
